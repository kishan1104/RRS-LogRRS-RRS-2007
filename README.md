# üîê RRS, LogRRS, and RRS-2007 Scheme Implementations

This repository contains the Python implementations of three cryptographic ring signature schemes:

- ‚úÖ **RRS** ‚Äì Our proposed Revocable Ring Signature scheme.
- ‚úÖ **LogRRS** ‚Äì Our Logarithmic size RRS scheme using NISA (Non Interactive Sum Argument System).
- ‚úÖ **RRS-2007** ‚Äì The foundational scheme proposed by Liu et al. in 2007.

These implementations are designed for research and experimental purposes, providing a foundation for benchmarking and extending ring signature cryptographic protocols.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Charm-Crypto >= 0.43
- fastecdsa >= 3.0.1
- sympy >= 1.12

Install required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Running the Code

**If you want to run it in google colab you can refer to the file installation of charm crypto on collab**.
Navigate to the desired scheme folder and execute the main test script. For example:

```bash
cd RRS and LOG-RRS/
python logrrs.py
```

## üî¨ Use Case

These schemes are designed to support **privacy-preserving authentication** with **revocation** capabilities, making them suitable for secure applications such as:

- VANETs (Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks)
- E-voting systems
- Decentralized identity systems

## üìå Notes

- This repository is intended **for academic and research use only**.
- The implementations are experimental and **not production-ready**.
- No formal license is currently associated with this project.
